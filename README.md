# Destiny 2 AFK Death Checker

## Description
This is a small Destiny 2 python tool for AFK XP farming.
It detects if the character dies while afk farming, if it does, the script will close the game and turn off the computer.
Right now it's intended for the void warlock + trinity ghoul xp farm.

You need to go into a cmd console and type the next command to install the script dependencies:
* pip install -r requirements.txt


To run the script just open a cmd console on the AFK Checker folder and type:
* python main.py

And that's it.

You can stop the script by closing it or pressing the "Esc" key. (For the time being you need to press Esc inside the command shell)

## Additional info

* First time you run the script you might encounter an error asking you to install an additional module.
* It now works in english!!!
* In-game resolution has to be 720p
